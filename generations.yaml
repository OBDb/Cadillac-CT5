    description: "The Cadillac CT5 is a mid-size luxury sedan that replaced the CTS in Cadillac's lineup. Built on GM's Alpha 2 platform with a rear-wheel drive layout (all-wheel drive optional), it features a fastback-inspired design with a longer, lower profile than its predecessor. The standard powertrain is a 2.0L turbocharged four-cylinder producing 237 HP, while Premium Luxury models offer an optional 3.0L twin-turbocharged V6 with 335 HP. The sport-oriented CT5-V increases the V6's output to 360 HP, while the high-performance CT5-V Blackwing, introduced in 2022, features a supercharged 6.2L V8 producing 668 HP, available with either a 6-speed manual or 10-speed automatic transmission. The interior offers a driver-focused cockpit with a 10-inch touchscreen, available digital instrument cluster, and premium materials including carbon fiber, leather, and real wood trim options. Technology features include wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, while the Super Cruise semi-autonomous driving system is available on higher trims. The CT5 represents Cadillac's attempt to compete more directly with European luxury sedans by offering distinctive styling, engaging driving dynamics, and advanced technology, while maintaining traditional Cadillac values of comfort and presence."
